# once every root that this image must admit has had the device layer that puts
# them there installed.
#
# They belong in the pin list on the merits -- the device layer moved them to
# the kernel's updates/ override tree precisely so that linux-firmware can no
# longer overwrite them, which makes them stable pins in a way the old
# /usr/lib/firmware/qcom/ path never was.  They are held back for one release
# for a sequencing reason, not a design one:
#
# stage 1 treats a *missing* pinned file exactly like a corrupt one.
# `initramfs/init:231` requires each contract path to be a regular file before
# it hashes anything, and rejects the whole root otherwise.  The roots this
# image has to boot today still carry the GPU firmware only at the old path.
# Pinning the new path now would therefore reject every existing root until the
# new layer is installed -- and the new layer is installed *from* a booted
# root.  That is the same old-image/new-root deadlock the dconf pins caused,
# and the reason not to fix it by relaxing stage 1 is that "verify it only if
# it happens to be there" is not a security property: it hands any attacker who
# can delete a file the ability to skip its check.  Stage 1 stays fail-closed.
#
# So: the layer ships them now, the contract pins them next, once the layer is
# everywhere.  The layer's own assertions already guarantee they are present
# and that the dpkg-owned path is empty.

# Native-install pin list. Same ownership discipline as the GNOME
# list above, adjusted for the deb layout: the SSC proxy gates at its diverted
# in-place path, the GPU blobs pin at their updates/ override home (the old
# sequencing deadlock is gone -- every native root ships them from day one),
# and development evidence tools (ssccli, uinput-automation, the audio probe)
# are intentionally absent: they must not decide whether the system boots.
