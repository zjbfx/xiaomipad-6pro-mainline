# Ubuntu and Fedora for Xiaomi Pad 6 Pro

Run Ubuntu 26.04 or Fedora Workstation on the Xiaomi Pad 6 Pro, with the GNOME desktop and a device-adapted kernel based on upstream Linux. [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This repository is a fork of [yzddmr6/xiaomipad-6pro-mainline](https://github.com/yzddmr6/xiaomipad-6pro-mainline) that adds a Fedora Workstation variant. The kernel, boot images, device layer and installation flow are shared between the two; only the root filesystem and the way the device layer is packaged differ.

## ⚠️ Read Before Installing

This project is only for the **Xiaomi Pad 6 Pro (liuqin, SM8475)**. Other Xiaomi Pad models are not compatible.

- **Data loss**: unlocking the bootloader and performing an initial installation erase user data. Back up your files first.
- **Storage and layout**: installation has been tested on one known **256 GB partition layout**, not every 256 GB device. Other capacities, modified partition layouts and slot-B installation are unverified and unsupported. Do not bypass the checks.
- **Validation scope**: initial installation, first boot, rotation, touch, the magnetic keyboard (including its touchpad), audio and USB OTG host mode (wired mouse) have been tested. Android recovery still requires separate device validation.
- **Installation layout**: Ubuntu is installed as the sole operating system. Android dual boot is not provided.
- **Recovery preparation**: obtain the matching stock firmware and read the [data and recovery instructions](docs/FLASHING.md#data-and-recovery) before installing.
- **Hardware limitations**: some features are incomplete. Review the hardware support table below.

Flashing an incorrect boot image or partition can prevent the tablet from starting. Follow the installation guide and keep your backups.
Factory calibration and device addresses must come from the same tablet; never copy them between devices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Use a complete installation bundle from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yzddmr6/xiaomipad-6pro-mainline/releases). Do not mix files from different versions.

| I want to | Read |
|---|---|
| Install Ubuntu | [Installation guide](docs/FLASHING.md) |
| Install Fedora Workstation | [Fedora guide](docs/FEDORA.zh-CN.md) (Chinese for now) |
| Build the kernel and device components | [Build guide](docs/BUILD.md) |
| Restore Android | [Data and recovery instructions](docs/FLASHING.md#data-and-recovery) |

Prebuilt installation bundles include matching boot and root filesystem images, installation tools and checksums.
Ubuntu bundles are published on the upstream project's [Releases](https://github.com/yzddmr6/xiaomipad-6pro-mainline/releases) page; the Fedora root filesystem is built locally from the official Fedora aarch64 repositories.

## 🐧 Fedora Workstation (first version)

Fedora Workstation on the same kernel and device support, built and used on the same reference device as the Ubuntu path (single boot, known 256 GB layout). Treat it as a first version: the desktop is usable, the edges are documented rather than smoothed.

| | |
|---|---|
| Base | Fedora Workstation 44, GNOME, aarch64, installed with `dnf --installroot` from official repositories only |
| Boot chain | Identical to the Ubuntu path: same kernel, device trees, boot image assembly, storage admission contract and installer image |
| Device layer | Installed as a file tree rather than as packages; the admission contract pins file hashes, not a package database |
| Packages | DNF |
| Waydroid | Ubuntu path only; not covered here |

Tools: [build-liuqin-fedora-rootfs.sh](tools/build-liuqin-fedora-rootfs.sh) for the root filesystem, [build-liuqin-fedora-native-root.sh](tools/build-liuqin-fedora-native-root.sh) for the device layer, preflight and packing, and `build-liuqin-image.py --distro fedora` for the images. The [Fedora guide](docs/FEDORA.zh-CN.md) covers the design, the build and the differences from the Ubuntu path.

Validated on the reference device: first boot, GDM login, desktop, Wi-Fi, touch, and the boot screens coming up landscape from the first frame (the boot command line declares the panel's mounting, so boot, Plymouth and the greeter no longer flip orientation mid-boot).

Not yet validated on Fedora: audio, Bluetooth, the magnetic keyboard, suspend/resume, USB OTG and anything marked partial or unverified in the tables below. Auto-rotation currently points the wrong way; see the sensor row below.

## Hardware Support

This describes hardware support and known limitations for Xiaomi Pad 6 Pro (liuqin).
Component identities come from confirmed board information
and device trees; other batches, capacities and accessory combinations are not implied tested.

### Wireless and USB

| Feature | Component / Implementation | Status | Scope and Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz | Qualcomm QCA6490 / ath11k | ✅ Working | Wireless connection and everyday networking |
| Wi-Fi 5 GHz | QCA6490, supported as WCN6855 family | ✅ Working | 5 GHz connections verified; no peak-throughput claim |

| USB reconnect after charging | USB-C / USB gadget | 🟡 Partial | Since v0.1.1 the UCSI typec controller negotiates automatically; a dedicated retest is pending |
| USB 3.x SuperSpeed | USB controller / PHY | 🧪 Unverified | Since v0.1.1 the SM8475 PHY tables and controller are in place; SuperSpeed peripheral enumeration untested |
| USB OTG / host mode | USB-C data-role switching | ✅ Working | Since v0.1.1 UCSI negotiates the role automatically; wired mouse validated, USB drives and docks pending |
| USB-C external display | Video output / docks | 🧪 Unverified | External-monitor output has not been tested |

### Audio, Video and Sensors

## Usage and Maintenance

Ubuntu packages are managed through APT and Fedora's through DNF. Update instructions for the project kernel and device components will accompany each installation release.
Do not mix boot images and system components from different releases.

To run Android applications inside Ubuntu, Waydroid is supported; the required kernel configuration is built in. See [Waydroid support](docs/WAYDROID.md). Waydroid is not covered by the Fedora path.

Report problems through GitHub Issues with the device model, system version, reproduction steps and relevant logs.
Remove passwords, network credentials and personal information before sharing logs.
The accounts listed above are also available for usage discussions.
